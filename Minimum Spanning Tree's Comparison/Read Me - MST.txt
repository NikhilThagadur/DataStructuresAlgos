Problem: Compare the performance of the following minimum spanning tree algorithms:

1. Prim's algorithm (implementation 1 - see lecture notes)
2. Prim's algorithm (implementation 2)
3. Kruskal's algorithm

Java files: PrimOne.java, PrimTwo.java, KruskalMST.java

Results Comparison: 
Iterations	Prim's Algo 2(Eager)	Prim's Algo 1(Lazy)	Kruskal MST
1		6			7			6.9
2		7			6.6			6.8	
3		7.2			7			5.8
4		7.3			7			7.3
5		5.9			7.2			6.4
6		5.5			7.1			6.3
7		6.6			7.3			6.8
8		6.7			6.8			6.7
9		6.3			6.9			6.2
10		6.5			5.4			6


Conclusion:
All three implementations have slight difference in their running time. Eager version of Prim’s Algorithm (Prim Implementation 2) being the best.
