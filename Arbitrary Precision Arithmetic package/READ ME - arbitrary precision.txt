Java file : ArithematicPrecision.java

Program Steps:
1.	Read the input expression
2.	Convert it into Post Fix expression
3.	While Evaluating the Post fix exp, Pop two numbers(String format) from the stack
4.	convert the numbers into polynomial form
5.	Store it in Link List
6.	Apply the operation(+,-,*,^) on two link list and store the result in another link list
7.	Store the result link list back to Stack for further Operation.
