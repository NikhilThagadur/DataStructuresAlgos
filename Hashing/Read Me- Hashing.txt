Problem: Compare the performance of the hashing algorithms


Algorithms Implemented:
•	Separate Chaining with 2 choice of Hashing
•	Double Hashing
•	Cuckoo Hashing with 2 Hash Tables
•	Cuckoo Hashing with 3 Hash Tables

Files Included:DoubleHash.java, SeparateChaining2Choice.java, CuckooHash2T.java, CuckooHash3T.java

Results Comparison: 
			Time in Seconds	
		Cuckoo Hashing(3 Tables)	Cuckoo Hashing(2 Tables)	Double Hashing	Separate Chaining
input File 1	0.8				0.5				0.8			1.2
Input File 2	0.4				0.4				0.4			1.3
Input File 3 	0.4				0.4				0.4			1.3
Input File 4	0.8				0.4				0.4			1.1
Input File 5	0.8				0.4				0.4			1.1
Input File 6	0.5				0.4				0.6			1.1

Conclusion:
Cuckoo hashing with 2 tables and Double Hashing performs equally well, slightly better than Cuckoo hashing with 3 tables
